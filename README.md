### Instruction

This game is created for the 100 years anniversary of WWI. It's a fast-pace first person shooting game. The code is hosted on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/unhappyfuntime/makelovenotwar). My partner Simon Ou Yang and I spent two semester working on this game as a senior research project for our Game Programming Specialization under the guidance of professor Richard McKenna. You can play the WebGL version of the game [here](https://yiochen.github.io/mlnw-webgl/).
